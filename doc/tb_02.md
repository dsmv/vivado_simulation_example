# tb_02 - use of virtual interfaces

The tb_02_vif example has the same functionality as the tb_01_axis example, but the test source code is split into several files:

* tb.sv - the top level of the test
* bind_user_axis.sv - the same file is used as in the tb_01_axis example
* tb_common/if/axi_stream_if.sv - interface declaration
* tb_02_pkg.sv - main testing procedures
* tb_02_monitor_pkg.sv - tb_02_monitor procedure

The core of the example is the use of SystemVerilog interfaces to connect to ports of the component being tested, and the use of SystemVerilog virtual interfaces to interact with task in SystemVerilog packages.

The tb component declares two interfaces:
````
//  Unit under test

axi_stream_if   #( .bytes ( n ) )  st0( clk );
axi_stream_if   #( .bytes ( n ) )  st1( clk );
````

The tb_02_pkg package declares the constant 'n' and virtual interfaces:
````
    localparam  n = 5, nb = n * 8;

    virtual     axi_stream_if   #( .bytes ( n ) )  _st0;
    virtual     axi_stream_if   #( .bytes ( n ) )  _st1;
````

In the tb_init, the st0, st1 interfaces are assigned to the _st0, _st1 virtual interfaces:
````
    _st0 = st0;
    _st1 = st1;
````

From this point on, interface signals can be controlled from all tasks of the tb_02_pkg package and from all places that import the tb_02_pkg package.

In this example, the functionality of generating test actions is transferred to the tb_02_pkg package, and the monitoring functionality is transferred to a separate tb_02_monitor_pkg package.

Please note that with this solution, the compilation order is important, which is specified in the sim02_vif/systemverilog.f file; The tb_02_pkg.sv file must be compiled earlier than tb_02_monitor.sv

## Setting up the Vivado simulator

By default, the Vivado simulator does not display SystemVerilog packages, so internal package signals are hidden. You need to enable package display.

## tb_02_vif disadvantages

This example uses the axis_stream_if interface, which is designed to model the AXI Stream bus and has its own write() and read() procedures, but these procedures are not used in the test. This is done to accurately transfer the example from tb_01_axis.

## Improvement opportunities

The user_axis component has two AXI Stream buses that are declared as separate signals. It is possible to rework the component in which the SystemVerilog interfaces will be used directly in the description of the component ports.
